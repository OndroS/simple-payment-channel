# simple-payment-channel

Work in Progress

It's basically Lightning on Ethereum.

Example app leveraging a simple uni-directional payment channel 

So, right now this isn't an application yet - that will be coming in the next few hours / tomorrow (July 29) 

I just was impatient to getting something out and all the tests are passing...

So, if you want to grab this and take a look at the tests, feel free to - for more information on this payment channel, [here's an article on medium](https://medium.com/@eolszewski/counterfactual-for-dummies-part-1-8ff164f78540) I wrote to give you an overview.

## Setup (To run the tests)

```
$ npm i
$ npm run test
```

And there will be an application that uses this with Metamask - I swear, it'll be interactive and cool.
